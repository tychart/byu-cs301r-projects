For my creative project related to Isaiah, I decided to make a book cover, as if Isaiah
was printed as a standalone book of scripture. I had a really cool vision in my head for how I
wanted to make it, but I am not a good artist at all. Thus, I had the idea of going through the
process of setting up a completely local set of image models, and then run everything on my
home computer using ComfyUI. This is a set of completely local (not internet connected), open
source, machine learning image models that generate images through a text prompt and a
starting image.
Starting out, I took my inspiration from seeing another classmate’s really cool project
where he did a pen drawing of a mountain landscape, and I wanted to do a different take on
the idea of a landscape with a bunch of tall mountains. I first went into a digital drawing
program, Krita, and drew out my ideas, going through 3 (very crude) iterations, trying each out
as starting images in the image generation software:After making the image in the drawing program, I fed it into a workflow that I designed
for using that image as a template for creating a much better and more realistic looking image.
That workflow takes both the image and 2 prompts, one prompt with positive keywords and the
other with negative keywords. This then uses a machine learning model that I downloaded to
be able to put that all together according to the KSampler node, which has settings like how
many times to feed the generated picture through the model in a loop, how similar to make the
resulting picture to the original image, and other things like that. It took quite a bit of tinkering
with over 100 different images generated (I left it going overnight after I spent a few hours
dialing in the settings). This image is the workflow that I used, along with an example output
image:
After getting the main image that I was going to use, I fed it into a pre-made workflow to
be able to add text in a font that I wanted over the top to make it look like a book or a movie
cover. I then used an image manipulation tool by Google to be able to cut out the person at thebottom to be able to make it only the natural landscape, broken by a heavenly beam, and
added that modified section onto my final image. The final workflow is shown below:
The processes described in the “Tools for Scripture Study” handout were useful in the
formulation and execution of this project. As I went back and was pondering on Isaiah 2, I was
considering how Isaiah might have felt as he was receiving revelation from God. I was also
considering how Isaiah prophesied about the mountain of the Lord’s house, and how it will be
the highest and most important place in all the earth. This reminded me of how the mountain
itself is often used as a symbol for the temple, as the closest one can get to God here on earth.
Thinking about this scripture in context, I was struck with two of the most amazing
images of receiving revelation that we have recorded, Moses talking with God in the burning
bush, and Joseph Smith’s first vision. Isaiah had some of the most important revelations for ustoday about the first and second coming of Christ, and I wanted to represent the revelation
given to Isaiah with a mix of the grandeur of the method of revelation by the other two
prophets. I wanted to make something that represented Isaiah and how important his
prophecies were to both the ancient Israelites as well as the modern followers of Christ today.
